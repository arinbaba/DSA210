# Magnesium Intake and Sleep Duration Project

## Motivation
I aimed to investigate the relationship between my daily magnesium intake (mg) and sleep duration (hours). Magnesium plays an important role in sleep regulation, so I tracked my intake and sleep hours for 50 consecutive days.

## Data
- 50 days of manually recorded data.
- Magnesium intake ranged between 220-330 mg.
- Sleep duration ranged between 5.5-7.5 hours.

## Methods
- Data exploration using descriptive statistics and visualization.
- Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the relationship.
- Hypothesis testing to assess significance.

## Findings
- A strong positive correlation was found between magnesium intake and sleep duration (p-value < 0.05).

## Limitations
- Only 50 days of data.
- Self-reported intake and sleep values.
- External factors like stress or diet were not considered.

## Future Work
- Collect more extensive data.
- Incorporate sleep quality measures.
- Build predictive models using machine learning.
